Welcome to AFM class
<p>The "AFM" in the context of an MCA syllabus likely refers to Advanced Financial Management
 or Accounting and Financial Management. This subject is typically introduced in the first year
 of an MCA program, often as a core course. The syllabus will cover fundamental accounting principles, 
financial management concepts, 
and possibly some aspects of financial modeling or analysis relevant to computer applications. </p>
