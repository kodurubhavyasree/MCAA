Welcome to Oops-lab class
<p>Classes and Objects:
      Understanding how to define classes as blueprints for creating objects, and how to instantiate objects from those classes. 

Encapsulation:
     Learning how to bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a class, and how to control access to them using access specifiers (e.g., public, private, protected). 

Inheritance:
    Exploring how to create new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes), inheriting their attributes and methods, and potentially adding new ones. 

Polymorphism:
     Understanding how objects of different classes can respond to the same method call in their own specific ways (e.g., through method overriding or operator overloading). 

Abstraction:
   Learning to represent essential features of an object while hiding complex implementation details.</p>
