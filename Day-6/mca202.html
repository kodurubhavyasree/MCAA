<p>Linear Data Structures:
Arrays: Fixed-size collections of elements accessed by index, including single and multi-dimensional arrays. 
Linked Lists: Dynamic collections of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Includes singly, doubly, and circular linked lists. 
Stacks: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure with operations like push, pop, and peek. Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. 
Queues: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure with operations like enqueue, dequeue, and peek. Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. 
Non-Linear Data Structures:
Trees: Hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. Includes concepts like binary trees, binary search trees, heaps, and balanced trees. 
Graphs: Structures representing relationships between objects, including nodes (vertices) and edges. Includes concepts like traversal (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms 
(Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford), and minimum spanning tree algorithms (Kruskal's, Prim's)</p>
