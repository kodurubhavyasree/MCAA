Welcome to OS class
<p>System Calls:
        Students learn to use and implement system calls in a Linux environment to interact with the operating system, 
     such as creating processes, managing files, and handling input/output operations. 

Process Management:
      This includes understanding process states, process scheduling algorithms 
      (like FCFS, Round Robin, SJF, Priority), and implementing them. 

CPU Scheduling:
    Students simulate and analyze various CPU scheduling algorithms 
    to understand their impact on system performance. 

Memory Management:
      This involves learning about memory allocation strategies (like First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit),
      page replacement algorithms (like FIFO, LRU, Optimal), and virtual memory concepts. 

File Systems:
   Students simulate file allocation methods and explore file organization techniques. 
Inter-Process Communication (IPC):
Implementing synchronization using semaphores and exploring named and unnamed pipes 
for communication between processes. 

Deadlock Handling:
    Understanding deadlock scenarios, their prevention, avoidance, and detection mechanisms. 

Thread Management:
   Implementing synchronized programs using multithreading concepts and understanding 
the benefits of threads over processes. </p>
