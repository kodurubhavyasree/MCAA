<p>Data warehousing and data mining are distinct but complementary processes. Data warehousing involves the collection, storage, and management of large datasets from various sources, while data mining focuses on analyzing this data to discover patterns, trends, and insights. In essence, data warehousing provides the foundation (the "warehouse" itself) for storing and organizing data, 
while data mining utilizes that data to extract valuable knowledge. </p>
