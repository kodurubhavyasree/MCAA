<p>A 1-year Master of Computer Applications (MCA) degree with a focus on e-commerce is typically not offered. Most MCA programs, including those with an e-commerce focus, are designed as 2-3 year courses. However, some universities offer accelerated online programs that may be completed within a shorter timeframe, potentially around 1-2 years. If you're interested in e-commerce, 
you can find specialized courses within a standard MCA program or pursue online options.</p>
